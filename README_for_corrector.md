I have a problem on test networkTest.connect, the number of excitatory firing neurons is 2, but it should be 1, and the results given by the proposed command are slightly different from the files provided on moodle
After a lot of time spent on looking from where it could come from, I did not find the mistake I made, maybe with more time I could have find it, but I am not sure about it.
